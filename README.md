A full stack web app made to help teams stay organized and productive. Built with React on the frontend and Express/PostgreSQL on the backend, and uses the [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) component library as well as [Footable](https://fooplugins.github.io/FooTable/).

This app was built as a final project for the Lighthouse Labs web development program by:
